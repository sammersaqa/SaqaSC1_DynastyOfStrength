    There’s no better day to go on a walk in the city of Citington, so that’s exactly what you do. It’s a beautiful day; The sun is shining, the grass is grassing, and the radiation factory you’re walking by is radiating. A little too hard, it seems. It’s… it’s exploding! For better or for worse, you had paused to admire your home right outside the radiation factory (that’s where they build radiation — don’t think about it too hard).
  </p>
  <p>
    You are thrown in the blast, but miraculously seem unharmed. As a matter of fact, you feel great. But different. Tingly, even. Dare I say… strong. You feel stronger than you’ve ever felt in your life! Positively swole! The radiation of the explosion has transformed you into an ultra-powerful version of yourself. You could potentially benchpress an elephant. No, two elephants! Maybe three, but that could be pushing it. Either way, you now have super powers.
  </p>
  <p>
    But with great power comes great responsibility, or something like that (shout out to an uncle named Ben). Now, you have a serious decision to make. Will you use these powers for good? Or will you walk the path of evil?
