        <h1>The Train Station</h1>

        <p>
          You hit up the train station. You’re incredibly strong and feeling
          pumped, so you decide to start big. You check to see if you can stop a
          train. With all the confidence in the world, you give it your best go.
          You’re strong, friend, but unfortunately not train-strong. Thus ends
          your superhero story. Tragic.

        alt="A detailed, stylized illustration of an abandoned train station at sunset. The train tracks stretch into the distance, flanked on both sides by massive, towering piles of junk, including rusty cars, barrels, washing machines, and scrap metal, suggesting a junkyard or demolition site. A dilapidated, graffiti-covered train is visible on the right track. The sky is a beautiful orange and pink gradient, contrasting with the desolate scene. Power lines hang low overhead, and a few flashes of lightning can be seen in the distance."
