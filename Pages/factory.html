        <p>
          There’s no better day to go on a walk in the city of Citington, so
          that’s exactly what you do. It’s a beautiful day; The sun is shining,
          the grass is grassing, and the radiation factory you’re walking by is
          radiating. A little too hard, it seems. It’s… it’s exploding! For
          better or for worse, you had paused to admire your home right outside
          the radiation factory (that’s where they build radiation — don’t think
          about it too hard).
        </p>

        <p>
          You are thrown in the blast, but miraculously seem unharmed. As a
          matter of fact, you feel great. But different. Tingly, even. Dare I
          say… strong. You feel stronger than you’ve ever felt in your life!
          Positively swole! The radiation of the explosion has transformed you
          into an ultra-powerful version of yourself. You could potentially
          bench press an elephant. No, two elephants! Maybe three, but that
          could be pushing it. Either way, you now have super powers.
        </p>

        <p>
          But with great power comes great responsibility, or something like
          that (shout out to an uncle named Ben). Now, you have a serious
          decision to make. Will you use these powers for good? Or will you walk
          the path of evil?
        </p>
