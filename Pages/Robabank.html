    <h1>ROB A BANK</h1>

    <p>A classic choice. Those super-strong arms are perfect for punching through bank walls at night and grabbing
        fistfuls of money! It’s genius! You wait for the cover of night and hit up your local bank. In the dark, you
        unleash blow after blow on the bricks until before you is a pile of rubble, and beyond that… a pile of money.</p>

    <p>It’s more money than you’ve ever dreamed of! You take as much as you can with you, and with your super strength
        that’s a lot of dough. You leave Citington the same way you arrived at the bank, quickly and in darkness.</p>

    <p>As you flee, you feel a suspiciously money-shaped void within you fill up. Turns out money can buy happiness.
        With all this financial prosperity, being evil doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. You buy a flight to a fancy
        island and take in the rays. The sun, the sand, the surf, the offshore account you set up in the Cayman islands…
        all of it fills you with satisfaction. You retire your evil ways and live out your days as a VERY financially
        secure surf instructor.</p>
