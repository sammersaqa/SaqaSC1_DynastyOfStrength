    <h1>THE JUNK YARD</h1>

    <p>You decide to hit up the junk yard. You throw junk around under the cover of night and get not only more ripped
        but super accustomed to your newfound powers. Nice!</p>

    <p>With those powers, you undertake self-assigned missions. You rescue cats from trees, help little old ladies cross
        the street, and benchpress cars. The last one isn’t life-changing, but it’s super cool. Aside from that, there’s
        not much disaster to be found in the city of Citington, so you wait. And wait. And wait.</p>

    <p>Finally, you get your big break! A bank robbery is happening! But what’s this? At the same time, there’s a house
        fire burning down a local home. You can only help with one. Which do you choose?</p>
