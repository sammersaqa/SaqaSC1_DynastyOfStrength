        <h1>The Junkyard</h1>

        <p>You decide to hit up the junkyard. You throw junk around under the cover of night and get not only more
            ripped but super accustomed to your newfound powers. Nice!</p>

        <p>With those powers, you undertake self-assigned missions. You rescue cats from trees, help little old ladies
            cross the street, and benchpress cars. The last one isn’t life-changing, but it’s super cool. Aside from
            that, there’s not much disaster to be found in the city of Citington, so you wait. And wait. And wait.</p>

        <p>Finally, you get your big break! A bank robbery is happening! But what’s this? At the same time, there’s a
            house fire burning down a local home. You can only help with one. Which do you choose?</p>
