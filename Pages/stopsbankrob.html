    <h1>BANK ROBBERY</h1>

    <p>You place your trust in Citington’s firefighters and dash toward the bank robbery with your super strong legs. An
        ultra cool fight scene ensues. There’s bullet dodging, there’s people-throwing, there’s cheering and women
        weeping with gratitude. It’s basically everything you dreamed of when you decided to become a superhero.</p>

    <p>The bank robber is arrested, and he swears a vendetta against you as he’s pulled away in cuffs. “I’ll have my
        revenge, if it’s the last thing I do!” he yells in your direction. You don’t worry about it too much, as this
        definitely won’t come back to bite you later.</p>

    <p>Time passes, and you continue to save the day again and again. You’re careful to always do so in costume so that
        you don’t blow your secret identity. You know. Classic superhero stuff. Pretty cool.</p>

    <p>One day, as you’re on the sidewalk in your very undisguised normal clothes, you see a car hurdling towards an old
        lady crossing the street. You could stop the car in its tracks and save the old lady, but your secret identity
        would be ruined! You have a choice to make. What do you do?</p>
