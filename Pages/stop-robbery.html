            <h1>Stop a Bank Robbery</h1>

            <p>You place your trust in Citington’s firefighters and dash toward the bank robbery with your super strong
                legs. An ultra cool fight scene ensues. There’s bullet dodging, there’s people-throwing, there’s
                cheering and women weeping with gratitude. It’s basically everything you dreamed of when you decided to
                become a superhero.</p>

            <p>The bank robber is arrested, and he swears a vendetta against you as he’s pulled away in cuffs. “I’ll
                have my revenge, if it’s the last thing I do!” he yells in your direction. You don’t worry about it too
                much, as this definitely won’t come back to bite you later.</p>

            <p>Time passes, and you continue to save the day again and again. You’re careful to always do so in costume
                so that you don’t blow your secret identity. You know. Classic superhero stuff. Pretty cool.</p>

            <p>One day, as you’re on the sidewalk in your very undisguised normal clothes, you see a car hurdling
                towards an old lady crossing the street. You could stop the car in its tracks and save the old lady, but
                your secret identity would be ruined! You have a choice to make. What do you do?</p>

    <img src="/Assets/stop-robbery.jpg" alt="A superhero stands victorious and powerfully in the middle of a street after stopping a bank robbery. He has a muscular build, a dark jacket ripped open to reveal his bare, shredded chest, and his eyes glow bright green while cyan electricity crackles around his arms. He is holding the bank robber, a man in a striped shirt, pinned over his shoulder. The robber yells in a speech bubble, 'I’LL GET YOU! THIS ISN’T OVER!' In the background, police are handcuffing another suspect by a police car with flashing lights, and a group of relieved citizens is watching the scene. The setting is an industrial area under a stormy, lightning-filled sky.">
