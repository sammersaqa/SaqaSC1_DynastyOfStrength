          A classic choice. Those super-strong arms are perfect for punching
          through bank walls at night and grabbing fistfuls of money! It’s
          genius! You wait for the cover of night and hit up your local bank. In
          the dark, you unleash blow after blow on the bricks until before you
          is a pile of rubble, and beyond that… a pile of money.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s more money than you’ve ever dreamed of! You take as much as you
          can with you, and with your super strength that’s a lot of dough. You
          leave Citington the same way you arrived at the bank, quickly and in
          darkness.

          As you flee, you feel a suspiciously money-shaped void within you fill
          up. Turns out money can buy happiness. With all this financial
          prosperity, being evil doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. You buy a
          flight to a fancy island and take in the rays. The sun, the sand, the
          surf, the offshore account you set up in the Cayman islands… all of it
          fills you with satisfaction. You retire your evil ways and live out
          your days as a VERY financially secure surf instructor.

In the left panel, the figure in a black and red suit stands in front of a ripped-open bank vault, glowing with red energy and surrounded by flying cash. In the right panel, the figure is outside the bank, carrying a large bag of money over his shoulder as a police car arrives with flashing lights."
