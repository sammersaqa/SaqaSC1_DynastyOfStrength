        <h1>Stop the Car</h1>

        <p>Your superhero instincts kick into high gear as you step between the car and the little old lady. You push
            against the front bumper, and the car grinds to a halt. The old lady weeps with gratitude. “It’s you!” she
            cries. “The superhero who’s been protecting our city!”</p>

        <p>“It’s nothin’, ma’am,” you reply. “All in a day’s work.”</p>

        <p>Your cover has been blown, but your conscience is clear. To your surprise and delight, the city reacts
            positively to your newly revealed identity. They applaud all that you’ve done for Citington and build a
            statue in the center of town in your honor. You continue to protect the citizens of Citington and live
            happily ever after.</p>

    <img src="/Assets/car-stop.jpg" alt="A powerful superhero, dressed in a grey shirt and jeans, stands in the middle of a city street at night, having just stopped a barreling car with his bare hands. He is in a wide stance, his eyes glow bright green, and arcs of glowing cyan electricity emanate from his hands. The front of the car is crumpled from the impact. To his right, a surprised elderly woman with a paper bag watches the action in awe. Lightning flashes in the dark, stormy sky above the city buildings.">
