        <h1>EVIL</h1>

        <p>With all this radiation coursing through your veins, something else has awakened within you. Something…
            dark.
            Something that both frightens and thrills you. You could do terrible things with this power, and that’s
            kind of
            exciting. The world is your evil oyster! What evil deed do you inflict upon the unsuspecting world
            first?</p>
