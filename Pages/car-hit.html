        <h1>Don't Stop the Car</h1>

        <p>Wow. Okay. The car does what cars do when they barrel towards old ladies. It’s not pretty.</p>

        <p>Your secret identity is safe, but at what cost? You have this ugly feeling in the pit of your stomach. You
            feel awful - and you should. You have to live with this now.</p>

        <p>You protected your identity, so you go on to save many, many more people. But the feeling doesn’t go away.
            You wake up in cold sweats every night hearing the crunch of the accident that you could have prevented.</p>

        <p>Plagued by guilt, you eventually retire. You’ve protected hundreds. It’s not enough. You’ve done some heroic
            things, and the world is better for it. But you could have saved her.</p>
