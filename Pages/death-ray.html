        <h1>Build a Death Ray</h1>

        <p>A classic choice, fit for a variety of supervillains. You go about meticulously constructing a death ray. You
            use your super strong arms to slot all of the fiddly bits of machinery into place. There’s wires involved,
            and some sheet metal. Definitely snack breaks. Quite possibly superglue. I’m not certain, as I’m no death
            ray expert personally. To each their own though.</p>

        <p>Finally, after months of painstaking work, your death ray is complete. It’s huge! It’s intimidating! It’s
            foreboding! And, as you trip over some left over wiring, it’s activating! The good news is all your hard
            work paid off. The death ray works! The bad news is that it works on you. Your career as a supervillain was
            short-lived, and so were you for that matter. Rest in peace, pal.</p>
