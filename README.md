We created an interactive digital storyline where the user's choices determine the fate of a character who gains superpowers after a factory explosion, leading to outcomes ranging from becoming a celebrated hero to a retired surf instructor or a tragic, early end.

## Peer Review

- Brandon Estrada - Your project is so well done. You guys were so creative with this and looks very professional. This looks like something a small indie comic book company would publish. I love the theme, story, and images you guys used. Amazing work!
