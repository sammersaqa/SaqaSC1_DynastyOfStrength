<p>There’s no better day to go on a walk in the city of Citington, so that’s exactly what you do. It’s a beautiful day;
    The sun is shining, the grass is grassing, and the radiation factory you’re walking by is radiating. A little too
    hard, it seems. It’s… it’s exploding! For better or for worse, you had paused to admire your home right outside the
    radiation factory (that’s where they build radiation - don’t think about it too hard).
</p>
<p>You are thrown in the blast, but miraculously seem unharmed. As a matter of fact, you feel great. But different.
    Tingly, even. Dare I say… strong. You feel stronger than you’ve ever felt in your life! Positively swole! The
    radiation of the explosion has transformed you into an ultra-powerful version of yourself. You could potentially
    benchpress an elephant. No, two elephants! Maybe three, but that could be pushing it. Either way, you now have super
    powers.
</p>
<p>But with great power comes great responsibility, or something like that (shout out to an uncle named Ben). Now, you
    have a serious decision to make. Will you use these powers for good? Or will you walk the path of evil?
</p>
<h1>EVIL</h1>
<p>
    With all this radiation coursing through your veins, something else has awakened within you. Something… dark.
    Something that both frightens and thrills you. You could do terrible things with this power, and that’s kind of
    exciting. The world is your evil oyster! What evil deed do you inflict upon the unsuspecting world first?
</p>
<h1>ROB A BANK</h1>
<p>
    A classic choice. Those super-strong arms are perfect for punching through bank walls at night and grabbing
    fistfulls of money! It’s genius! You wait for the cover of night and hit up your local bank. In the dark, you
    unleash blow after blow on the bricks until before you is a pile of rubble, and beyond that… a pile of money.
</p>
<p>
    It’s more money than you’ve ever dreamed of! You take as much as you can with you, and with your super strength
    that’s a lot of dough. You leave Citington the same way you arrived at the bank, quickly and in darkness.
</p>
<p>
    As you flee, you feel a suspiciously money-shaped void within you fill up. Turns out money can buy happiness. With
    all this financial prosperity, being evil doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. You buy a flight to a fancy island
    and take in the rays. The sun, the sand, the surf, the offshore account you set up in the Cayman islands… all of it
    fills you with satisfaction. You retire your evil ways and live out your days as a VERY financially secure surf
    instructor.
</p>
<h1>NEUTRAL ENDING</h1>

<h1>BUILD A DEATH RAY</h1>
<p>
    A classic choice, fit for a variety of supervillains. You go about meticulously constructing a death ray. You use
    your super strong arms to slot all of the fiddly bits of machinery into place. There’s wires involved, and some
    sheet metal. Definitely snack breaks. Quite possibly superglue. I’m not certain, as I’m no death ray expert
    personally. To each their own though.
</p>
<p>Finally, after months of painstaking work, your death ray is complete. It’s huge! It’s intimidating! It’s foreboding!
    And, as you trip over some left over wiring, it’s activating! The good news is all your hard work paid off. The
    death ray works! The bad news is that it works on you. Your career as a supervillain was short-lived, and so were
    you for that matter. Rest in peace, pal.
</p>
<h1>BAD ENDING</h1>
<h1>GOOD</h1>
<p>
    Looks like your moral compass is just as strong as those arms! Look at you, deciding to save the world and do good
    and stuff. You’re gonna do great things, probably. But first, you need to test your limits! Figure out what you can
    do! Eye-of-the-tiger training montage! Where do you decide to train?
</p>
<h1>THE TRAIN STATION</h1>
<p>
    You hit up the train station. You’re incredibly strong and feeling pumped, so you decide to start big. You check to
    see if you can stop a train. With all the confidence in the world, you give it your best go. You’re strong, friend,
    but unfortunately not train-strong. Thus ends your superhero story. Tragic.
</p>
<h1>BAD ENDING</h1>

<h1>THE JUNK YARD</h1>
<p>You decide to hit up the junk yard. You throw junk around under the cover of night and get not only more ripped but
    super accustomed to your newfound powers. Nice!
</p>
<p>With those powers, you undertake self-assigned missions. You rescue cats from trees, help little old ladies cross the
    street, and benchpress cars. The last one isn’t life-changing, but it’s super cool. Aside from that, there’s not
    much disaster to be found in the city of Citington, so you wait. And wait. And wait.
</p>
<p>Finally, you get your big break! A bank robbery is happening! But what’s this? At the same time, there’s a house fire
    burning down a local home. You can only help with one. Which do you choose?
</p>
<h1>FIRE</h1>

<p>With your super strong legs, you dash toward the burning building and head straight inside. You are so, SO strong,
    and yet so flammable. Unfortunate. You had a good run, bud. The end.
</p>

<h1>BAD ENDING</h1>

<h1>>BANK ROBBERY</h1>


<p>You place your trust in Citington’s firefighters and dash toward the bank robbery with your super strong legs. An
    ultra cool fight scene ensues. There’s bullet dodging, there’s people-throwing, there’s cheering and women weeping
    with gratitude. It’s basically everything you dreamed of when you decided to become a superhero.
</p>
<p>The bank robber is arrested, and he swears a vendetta against you as he’s pulled away in cuffs. “I’ll have my
    revenge, if it’s the last thing I do!” he yells in your direction. You don’t worry about it too much, as this
    definitely won’t come back to bite you later.
</p>
<p>Time passes, and you continue to save the day again and again. You’re careful to always do so in costume so that you
    don’t blow your secret identity. You know. Classic superhero stuff. Pretty cool.
</p>
<p>One day, as you’re on the sidewalk in your very undisguised normal clothes, you see a car hurdling towards an old
    lady crossing the street. You could stop the car in its tracks and save the old lady, but your secret identity would
    be ruined! You have a choice to make. What do you do?
</p>
<h1>GOOD ENDING</h1>

<h1>STOP THE CAR</h1>

<p>Your superhero instincts kick into high gear as you step between the car and the little old lady. You push against
    the
    front bumper, and the car grinds to a halt. The old lady weeps with gratitude. “It’s you!” she cries. “The superhero
    who’s been protecting our city!”</p>

<p>“It’s nothin’, ma’am,” you reply. “All in a day’s work.”
</p>
<p>Your cover has been blown, but your conscience is clear. To your surprise and delight, the city reacts positively to
    your newly revealed identity. They applaud all that you’ve done for Citington and build a statue in the center of
    town
    in your honor. You continue to protect the citizens of Citington and live happily ever after.
</p>
<h1>DON’T STOP THE CAR</h1>

<p>Wow. Okay. The car does what cars do when they barrel towards old ladies. It’s not pretty.
</p>
<p>Your secret identity is safe, but at what cost? You have this ugly feeling in the pit of your stomach. You feel awful
    -
    and you should. You have to live with this now.</p>

<p>You protected your identity, so you go on to save many, many more people. But the feeling doesn’t go away. You wake
    up
    in cold sweats every night hearing the crunch of the accident that you could have prevented. Plagued by guilt, you
    eventually retire. You’ve protected hundreds. It’s not enough. You’ve done some heroic things, and the world is
    better
    for it. But you could have saved her.</p>
